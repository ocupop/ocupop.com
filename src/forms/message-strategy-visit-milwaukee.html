The Message Strategy exercise is the critical first step of any successful communications campaign or project. The end results of this process establish a road map for brands to follow in campaigns and efforts across all stakeholders and media. All materials generated should speak to the principles laid out in the Message Strategy.</small><br /><br />

<small>This preliminary process often is part of a greater holistic effort to establish a clear, consistent strategy on behalf of the brand. Whether we are merely gaining insight to better inform our work, developing a brand framework centered on brand vision and goals, or outlining and articulating a communication approach in digital or physical spaces, this effort is key in helping us—and your core audiences—understand the core of what makes your brand/product/company tick.
