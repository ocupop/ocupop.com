              The Message Strategy exercise is the critical first step of any
              successful marketing or advertising campaign. The results of this
              process establish a road map for the company to follow in
              campaigns across all media. All advertising and marketing
              generated around a specific brand or product should speak to the
              principles laid out in the Message Strategy. This preliminary
              process often is part of a greater holistic marketing effort
              aiming to establish a Positioning Statement. Just as the Message
              Strategy establishes an advertising road map, the Positioning
              Statement provides the company with a distilled Brand Directive
              which guides actions across all aspects of business....From
              operations, to sales, to marketing, to shipping, to customer
              service, the Positioning Statement is a mantra that drills to the
              core of what makes your brand tick.
