    <p>Michael Nieling is a designer, educator, husband, father, and full time
    spaz. Splitting time between studios in Hawaii, British Columbia,
    California, and Wisconsin, if he's not on an airplane, he's likely somewhere
    shouting about branding and design.</p><p>Michael has been helping to define
    the visual language of our digital experience since 2000. As Creative
    Director and founder of Ocupop, he has led projects for companies,
    foundations, and non-profits at all ends of the spectrum - from Google,
    Facebook and Mozilla to countless successful (and horribly failed) startups
    to cause-driven work with ProPublica, FIRST, ReFED, and the IRC and W3C,
    Michael has directed his small, super-powered team in creating some of the
    most influential logos, campaigns, and user interfaces on the web and
    beyond.</p><p>Prior to founding Ocupop, Michael received his Masters of
    Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin with a
    focus on product design. His graduate studies centered around hybrid vehicle
    powertrain research for the Environmental Protection Agency and Ford Motor
    Company. Michael lives in Kahala on the island of Oahu and tries to surf,
    skate, and snowboard as often as possible—working hard to keep up with his
    daughter Izzy and son Håkan.</p>

    <p>Peter Lubbers fuses operational expertise with a deep insight into
    critical user journeys and business strategy. As a Developer Relations
    Director at Google, Peter established himself as a trailblazer in impactful,
    scalable developer content production, educating, informing, and inspiring
    millions of developers globally.</p><p>Author of "Pro HTML5 Programming"
    (Apress) and founder of the San Francisco HTML5 Developer Meetup (the
    world’s largest web developer community), Peter's passion for technology
    transcends the digital realm; and, yes, he's indeed the proud owner of that
    HTML5 license plate!</p><p>As the Chief Operating Officer at Ocupop, Peter
    ensures that strategic foresight underpins every project, always emphasizing
    a balance between visionary ambitions and on-the-ground reality, all while
    nurturing a robust 'Business Owner Thinking' ethos.&nbsp;</p><p>Away from
    his desk, Peter is either spending quality time with his wife Vittoria and
    two sons Sean and Rocky, running around the trails of the Tahoe National
    Forest, or jumping out of a plane (with a parachute), capturing the essence
    of every exhilarating moment.</p>

    <p>Tom Beck thrives in the uncommon space between. Between engineering and
    design; between constant motion and careful consideration; between the
    impossibly taxing and the insanely relaxing. Tom excels equally on both ends
    of a unique duality and at every point in between. As the Chief Technical
    Officer of Ocupop, Tom has led the firm’s tight team of designers,
    developers and strategists to create revolutionary user experiences,
    applications, and brand activations for clients large and small.</p><p>From
    Google and Mozilla to IRC, Sustainable America, and the Mott Foundation, Tom
    connects the inspiration and energy of Ocupop’s category-defining designs
    with its groundbreaking engineering output. Just as comfortable defining
    data models as he is in debating design details, Tom’s unique perspective
    and unending enthusiasm for getting shit done makes every Ocupop employee,
    client and colleague more productive, more successful, and just plain
    happier to be alive.</p><p>Prior to joining Ocupop, Tom received his BS from
    University of Colorado, Boulder before working extensively for Merrill Lynch
    on global event concepting and production.&nbsp; Equally at home in the
    mountains of British Columbia as in the barrel at Honolua Bay, the Beck’s
    (Tom, Nicole, Evan and Leila) stay on the move, splitting time between
    Whistler and Maui, making sure to make the most of both extremes…and each
    and every minute in between.</p>
