    <p>As one of the leading machine learning platforms in the world, the event
    design needs to reflect that same technical, complex nature visually,
    communicate the event flow effectively and garner enthusiasm for attendees
    about the future of the product. Ocupop has created full spectrum identity
    systems for multiple events designing assets big and small from badges and
    stickers to stage design and opening animations.</p>
