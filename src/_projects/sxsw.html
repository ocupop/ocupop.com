    <p>In 2016, SXSW had a big push for their Convergence programming, a
    cross-pollination between event tracks. In order to promote this push,
    Ocupop was brought in to create an animation to introduce and explain
    Convergence programming to attendees. In addition to the animation we
    designed an easy to digest schedule, which was included in their printed
    program for each attendee, along with a digital book to be shared
    online.</p>
