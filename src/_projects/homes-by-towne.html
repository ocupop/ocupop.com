    <p>Homes by Towne is a semi-custom home developer operating across the US.
    With over 30 communities spanning from Florida to Hawaii, Homes by Towne has
    been constructing homes for nearly 70 years. Homes by Towne approached
    Ocupop seeking a clean and fresh rebrand and new website that made it easy
    for would-be home buyers to find and build their dream home.</p>
  solution_html: >-
    <p>A company so caring about it&rsquo;s customers and product needed a new
    identity that showed that. We developed a new brand system evolving
    Homes&rsquo; old identity into a new mark showcasing the communities they
    create. A new website was also built with a streamlined user experience
    designed to compare models and drive buyers into a Homes by Towne sales
    office.</p>
