    <p>Homes by Towne is a semi-custom home developer operating across the US.
    With over 30 communities spanning from Florida to Hawaii, Homes by Towne has
    been constructing homes for nearly 70 years. Homes by Towne approached
    Ocupop seeking a clean and fresh rebrand and new website that made it easy
    for would-be home buyers to find and build their dream home.</p>
  solution_html: >-
    <p>A company so caring about it&rsquo;s customers and product needed a new
    identity that showed that. We developed a new brand system evolving
    Homes&rsquo; old identity into a new mark that showcased the communities
    they create though stepping stone pathways and an aerial view of community
    plots. A hidden T mark representing the Towne company family adds a playful
    swoosh carried throughout the rest of the brand system.<br />A new website
    was also built with a streamlined user experience designed to compare models
    and drive buyers into a Homes by Towne sales office. Image styles were
    developed to accentuate and reflect the beauty and scenery these communities
    have.</p>
