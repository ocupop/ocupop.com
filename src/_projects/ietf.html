    <p>The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) is a governing body who
    develops and promotes internet standards. They have many initiatives going
    on at all times, and frequently require visual identities to be associated
    with their projects.</p>
  solution_html: >-
    <p>&bull; IPv6 (2012?)</p><p>&bull; QUIC (Feb 2017)<br />IETF approached us
    to create a visual identity to represent a set of multiplexed connections
    between two endpoints of UDP. QUIC was created to improve perceived
    performance of connection-oriented web applications that are currently suing
    TCP.</p><p>We worked through a whole shitload of ideas representative of
    connections, data transportation, Q letterforms and ultimately ended at a
    point that embodied each of those elements in a clear and concise
    manner</p><p>&bull; TLS 1.3 (Mar 2018)<br />Transport Layer Security is a
    protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating
    applications. It&rsquo;s the most widely deployed security protocol used
    today, and is used for web browsers and other applications that require data
    to be securely exchanged over a network. TLS 1.3 addresses the
    vulnerabilities that have been exposed over the past few years, reducing the
    chance of implementation errors and removing features no longer needed. TLS
    1.3 is faster, more secure and easier to implement</p><p>Secure, fast,
    exchange / Technical, precise / Abstracted T, L, and S
    letterforms&nbsp;</p><p>&bull; ACME (Sept 2018)<br />ACME provides a
    standard way to easily and automatically authenticate identity in online
    communications. It is an open protocol that extends the automation process
    of Let&rsquo;s Encypt. ACME helps a website prove it&rsquo;s part of a
    domain</p><p>Our final solution was crafted to be recognized as a
    fingerprint, with forms designed to create a simplified/abstracted A
    letterform, all in a badge-like shape without overtly looking like a badge
    or shield</p>
