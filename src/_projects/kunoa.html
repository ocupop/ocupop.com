    <p>Kunoa sought to change the way Hawaiians consumed beef. With nearly all
    all cattle in Hawaii imported, Kunoa saw a system where beef could be raised
    in a local and sustainable way with having minimal impact on the Hawaiian
    ecosystem.</p>

    <p>Putting the lush Hawaiian landscape on a pedaste, Ocupop developed an
    identity system visually based on Hawaiian culture and sceanery. Rough hand
    lettering paired with gritty illustrations conveyed a cowboy-tough yet
    beautiful-woodcut feel for this sustainable food company. An informational
    website was designed and developed to educate consumers on sustainable food
    practices and create a local food community.</p>
