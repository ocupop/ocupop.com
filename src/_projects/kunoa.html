          <p>98% of the beef consumed in Hawaii is imported. Kunoa is changing that. Hawaii’s only vertically integrated cattle company is ushering in a future where food is locally raised with integrity and care. A future where produce and protein is abundant, fresh, and healthy. A future where Hawaii can stand proud and free, flush with local food as rich as the islands themselves.</p>
