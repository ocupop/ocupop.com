    <p>Heirloom Liqueurs was started by Bittercube&rsquo;s Proprietors, Ira and
    Nick, and their R&amp;D lead, Brandon Reyes. With their collective
    experience in the craft cocktail industry and extensive batches of their
    liqueurs for their own classes and training programs, they decided it was
    time to bring their products to market. With Heirloom, the guys set out to
    create fresh twists on revered flavors, for those with an appreciation of
    craft/ complexity, and a desire for something new. They approached us with a
    need to create a brand identity, system for label design, and a
    website.&nbsp;</p>
  solution_html: >-
    <p>We set out to create an identity that would be at once unique to
    Heirloom, while having a subtle, familial connection to the Bittercube
    brand. The H monogram is a modern take on antique, decorative letterforms,
    which also includes organic, leaf-like shape, symbolic of Heirloom's usage
    of all natural botanicals.</p>
