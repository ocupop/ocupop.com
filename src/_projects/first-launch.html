    <p>FIRST Inspires aims to get children ages 6-18 involved in STEM and STEM
    related fields. Each year FIRST holds a themed tournament comprising of four
    different competitions children participate in. Each competition presents
    the children with a new challenge that requires teamwork, communication, and
    STEM principles to complete. Oh and robots too.</p>

    <p>FIRST came to Ocupop looking for a cohesive brand identity for their 2019
    competition that felt professional while appealing to kids. Under the
    overarching brand, all four competitions also need identities that were tied
    to the theme but distinctly different. Teaser animations and illustrations
    were developed to spark interest alongside an overarching website explaining
    and informing this years theme and challenges. Clothing items and posters
    were also developed for participants to show their pride alongside other
    various swag items</p>
