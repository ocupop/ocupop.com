  <p>Bittercube Bitters slow crafts bitters using all natural ingredients, and
  no extracts of any kind. Hailing from Milwaukee and Minneapolis, Bittercube
  has been in the craft cocktail industry since 2009. Bittercube needed to
  elevate their brand to match the quality and sophistication of their products,
  philosophy, and team. And once they saw the new logo, every one of &lsquo;em
  had a new tattoo!</p>

          <p class="mb-0 editable">Early in the research and brand strategy phase of this project, we decided that it would be ideal to maintain the
          individual elements of the original ID if at all possible. The dropper and cube of bitters nearly phonetically spelled
          out the brand name and always kept the hand-crafted feel front and center. With Bittercubeâ€™s passion for true
          craftsmanship and commitment to producing their bitters by hand, with care, we saw an opportunity to apply the same
          ideas to their rebrand.</p>

            <p>The Bittercube website was a clear reflection of their new brand and identity. We were able to showcase clear messaging and visuals to match the brand. The recipe functionality brought to life a large repertoire of excellent recipes and provided the client a toolset to manage an ever-growing data set.
