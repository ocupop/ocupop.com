    <p>Bittercube Bitters slow crafts bitters using all natural ingredients, and
    no extracts of any kind. Based in both MKE, WI and MPLS, MN, Bittercube has
    been in the craft cocktail industry since 2009.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Bittercube sought out Ocupop to help elevate their brand perception to a
    level which matches the quality and sophistication of not only their
    products, but philosophy and company culture as well.</p><p>As we began
    digging into the redesign, we started our explorations with seeing if there
    was a way to simply take the existing elements of their mark (a dropper and
    cube of salt) and reimagine them using different forms/geometry and
    composition. This led to our ultimate decision to extract the strongest
    elements of their original logo &mdash; the dropper and the bitters &mdash;
    and create a new way for this to be communicated. With Bittercube&rsquo;s
    passion for true craftsmanship and commitment to producing their bitters by
    hand, with care, we saw an opportunity to apply the same ideas to their
    rebrand. We created a custom wordmark/logotype and custom, hand drawn
    illustrations for each product offering.</p>
