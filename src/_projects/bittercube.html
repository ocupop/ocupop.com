          <p>Early in the research and brand strategy phase of this project, we decided that it would be ideal to maintain the
          individual elements of the original ID if at all possible. The dropper and cube of bitters nearly phonetically spelled
          out the brand name and always kept the hand-cra ed feel front and center. With Bittercube’s passion for true cra
          smanship and commitment to producing their bitters by hand, with care, we saw an opportunity to apply the same ideas to
          their rebrand.</p>
