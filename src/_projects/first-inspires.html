    <p>The FIRST Inspires program creates competitions and events (both locally
    and internationally) to get children involved in STEM concepts as early as
    possible. In addition to hard skills, FIRST also teaches kids gracious
    professionalism and coopetition while installing their core values--
    Discovery, innovation, impact, inclusion, teamwork, and fun. In combination,
    FIRST is setting up today&rsquo;s students to be tomorrow&rsquo;s
    innovators.</p>

    <p>Ocupop and FIRST came together to create a collection of posters
    promoting science and engineering on a widespread scale. A series of
    advertisements were also created to promote FIRST specific programs as well
    as fun STEM related infographics, Illustrations, and event banners.</p>
