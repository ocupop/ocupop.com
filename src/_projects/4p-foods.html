<p>4P brings together individuals and families who want high-quality, fresh,
natural food with the farmers who are working tirelessly to grow food in
their area. They collect food from a network of over 200 farms in the D.C.
area and deliver weekly produce, meat or dairy bags directly to
consumers.</p>
<p>Ocupop created a new identity system that focused on capturing the local
&amp; friendly appeal balanced with trust and impact.</p>
