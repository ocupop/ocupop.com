    <p>A family business that began as a artful experiment turned into a full
    fledged passion for product design which lead co-founders Mario and Kitty
    Costello to form Daughter MFG. With a name picked out- inspired by their two
    daughters- and a lineup of handcrafted brass and resin home products, they
    came to Ocupop looking for an identity to call home both off and on the
    web.</p>

    <p>We crafted a sophisticated brand identity that mirrors the elegant and
    modern yet timeless style of the products they create. It is clear they are
    passionate and we wanted that dedication and attention to detail to come
    across in the packaging and website design as an extension of the
    brand.&nbsp;</p>
