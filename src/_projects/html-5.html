    <p>The web is a constantly evolving space. As more and more things becomes
    possible to do on the web, standards must evolve; enter HTML 5, a new set of
    syntax and tags to help clean and standardize the way HTML is written across
    the globe.</p>

    <p>Such a momentous change to the markup language needed a symbol that was
    as strong and universal as the concepts it represented. Ocupop developed a
    big, bold, bright badge that stands true to those concepts and symbolizes
    the progress that happens continuously around the net. The mark remains open
    source just as many of frameworks that power the web.<br />&nbsp;</p>
