    <p>Mapbox is the open source location data platform for mobile and web applications that provides building blocks to add location features like maps, search, and navigation into any experience a user creates.</p>
    <p>Mapbox recently asked us to help them amplify their standing as a world class technology leader at their inaugural conference at Pier 27 in San Francisco. With a name already established, Mapbox needed an new message strategy and branding to make a lasting impact, and better reflect their company and cutting edge developer products.</p>
  solution_html: >-
    <p>Working on a tight timeline we designed a new identity system that showcases Mapbox as an emerging light among map providers. We strategized and realized marketing campaigns for the event that explored the edges of design via interactive billboards, immersive stage animations, and futuristic signage.</p>
