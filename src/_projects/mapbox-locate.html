    <p>Mapbox is an open source mapping platform that sought out Ocupop to help
    establish themselves as a world class tech company with branding and event
    design for their inaugural conference at Pier 27 in San Francisco. Equipped
    with a name and preliminary branding, Mapbox was looking for repositioning
    of their brand to reflect the bold and cutting edge developer products and
    culture that they are pushing out into the world.</p>
  solution_html: >-
    <p>We created a new identity system that focused on presenting Mapbox an
    emerging light on the map location scene. We strategized marketing campaigns
    and explored the edges of design with an interactive billboard, immersive
    stage animations, and a sophisticated, futuristic aesthetic to signage and
    digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
